            <h3>Our Menus</h3>
            <p>
                As the seasons change, so too does the availability of the ingredients we use in our food. We have no
                set dates for this and we never change the whole menu at once. Instead, the menu evolves as different
                produce from our Yorkshire farms becomes available to us.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our tasting menu offers a selection of courses that James and the team believe best showcases the
                current harvest from the farm, alongside produce thatâ€™s been preserved throughout the year. Or for those
                with smaller appetites or limited time, a shorter lunch menu is also available from Thursday to
                Saturday. Both the lunch and tasting menus can be enjoyed with an optional drinks package, served
                alongside courses.
